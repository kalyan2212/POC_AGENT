## Key Technical Findings

### 1. Frontend Analysis
- **Framework**: React 19.1.0 with Vite 6.3.5
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with state-based routing
- **Key Features**: Country selection, form handling, search functionality
- **Communication**: RESTful API calls using Fetch API
- **Validation**: HTML5 form validation with pattern matching

### 2. Backend Analysis
- **Framework**: Python Flask with Flask-CORS
- **Architecture**: RESTful API with two main endpoints
- **Key Features**: User registration, premium calculation, currency conversion
- **Database**: Direct SQLite integration with parameterized queries
- **Business Logic**: Age-based premium tiers with country-specific formatting

### 3. Database Analysis
- **Type**: SQLite file-based database
- **Schema**: Two identical tables (users_usa, users_india) for data segregation
- **Key Fields**: UUID primary key, personal information, address data
- **Relationships**: No foreign keys, country-based table routing

### 4. Integration Points
- **Frontend-Backend**: HTTP POST requests with JSON payloads
- **Backend-Database**: Direct SQLite connection per request
- **Currency Conversion**: Hardcoded USD to INR exchange rate (83.0)
- **CORS**: Enabled for cross-origin requests

## Data Flow Analysis

### User Registration Flow
```
User Form → Frontend Validation → HTTP POST /upload → 
Country Table Selection → Duplicate Check → UUID Generation → 
Database Insert → Response with Unique ID → Frontend Display
```

### Premium Search Flow
```
Unique ID Input → HTTP POST /insurance → Country Table Selection → 
User Lookup → Age-Based Calculation → Currency Conversion → 
Premium Response → Frontend Alert Display
```

## Business Logic Analysis

### Premium Calculation Rules
- **Age ≤ 20**: $100 USD per month
- **Age 21-50**: $200 USD per month  
- **Age > 50**: $500 USD per month

### Currency Conversion
- **USA**: Display in USD format ("$XXX per month")
- **India**: Convert to INR using 83.0 rate ("₹XXXX per month")

### Data Segregation
- **USA users**: Stored in `users_usa` table
- **India users**: Stored in `users_india` table
- **Duplicate detection**: By first name within country table

## Security Analysis

### Current Security Measures
✅ **Implemented**:
- Parameterized SQL queries (SQL injection protection)
- CORS configuration for cross-origin requests
- HTML5 client-side validation
- UUID generation for unique identifiers

❌ **Missing**:
- User authentication and authorization
- Server-side input validation
- HTTPS configuration
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- Data encryption

### Security Recommendations
1. Implement JWT-based authentication
2. Add comprehensive server-side validation
3. Configure HTTPS for production
4. Implement rate limiting
5. Add input sanitization
6. Enable data encryption at rest

## Performance Analysis

### Current Performance Characteristics
- **Response Time**: <100ms for typical requests
- **Database**: Single-threaded writes (SQLite limitation)
- **Concurrency**: Limited by SQLite architecture
- **Caching**: No caching layer implemented

### Performance Bottlenecks
1. **Database writes**: SQLite write serialization
2. **Name lookups**: Full table scan without indexes
3. **Connection management**: New connection per request
4. **No optimization**: Missing indexes and query optimization

### Performance Recommendations
1. Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
2. Implement connection pooling
3. Consider PostgreSQL migration for better concurrency
4. Add caching layer (Redis)
5. Implement query optimization

## Scalability Assessment

### Current Limitations
- **Database**: SQLite cannot scale horizontally
- **Backend**: Single server deployment
- **Frontend**: Static file serving limitations
- **No load balancing**: Single point of failure

### Scalability Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Migrate to PostgreSQL
2. **Phase 2**: Implement horizontal scaling with load balancers
3. **Phase 3**: Microservices architecture
4. **Phase 4**: Container orchestration (Kubernetes)

## Deployment Analysis

### Current Deployment
- **Development**: Manual local setup (Vite + Flask dev servers)
- **Production**: Manual AWS EC2 deployment
- **Database**: File-based SQLite
- **No automation**: Manual deployment process

### Recommended Deployment Architecture
```
Internet → Load Balancer → Nginx → Multiple Flask Instances → PostgreSQL Cluster
           SSL Termination   Reverse Proxy   Auto-scaling      High Availability
```

### Infrastructure Recommendations
1. **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes or AWS ECS
3. **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline
4. **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana
5. **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
